Hey there! I am an undergraduate researcher at Stanford University where I study computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Currently, I'm working in Proffessor Sanmi Koyejo's [STAIR lab](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/) where my primary focus is on automated theorem proving.

Previously, I've worked on controlling robots with language, creating robust agents through adversarial reinforcement learning, and mapping burned regions from satellite imagery. I am passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems and improve safety and reliability of these systems.

Off the grid, I am enthusiastic about Ultimate Frisbee and take pride in representing Stanford as co-captain of Stanford's club team, Huck-Syndrome. I believe in fostering a challenging and competitive environment.

Creatively, I find joy in pottery, taking joy in envisioning and moulding unique designs. This form of artistry provides a counterbalance to my research-focused lifestyle.
